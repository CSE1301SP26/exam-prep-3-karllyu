	 * We wish to create a Laptop class. A Laptop is a Computer, 
	and should inherit from the Computer class from the previous problem. 
	The main difference between a Laptop and a Computer is that laptops have 
	the ability to open and close. This can affect the state of the computer 
	(whether it is asleep or not) as well as whether the button is able to be pressed. 
	Your Laptop class should include an instance variable to track whether the laptop is 
	currently open or not.

		The beginnings of this class have been provided to you below. 
		Examine the instructions and complete what remains.
